### Hardware Setup

- **Throat Microphone**: [CodeRed Assault MOD Tactical Throat Mic Headset](https://coderedheadsets.com/assault-mod-tactical-throat-mic-headset/)
  - Uses standard 3.5mm audio jack
  - Direct connection to MacBook Air's 3.5mm port
  - Note: Many USB-C to 3.5mm microphone adapters are not compatible with throat microphones

### Dataset Summary

A high-quality dataset of throat microphone (laryngophone) recordings specifically designed for fine-tuning Whisper and other speech recognition models. The dataset consists of 724 carefully selected English sentences recorded using a throat microphone, which captures speech through vibrations in the throat rather than air-conducted sound.

This dataset is particularly valuable for:
- Training ASR models for noisy environments
- Adapting speech recognition to throat microphone input
- Developing robust voice activity detection
- Research in alternative speech input methods

### Dataset Statistics

- **Total Recordings:** 724
- **Total Duration:** 120.1 minutes

- **Standard Deviation:** 0.3s

Duration Distribution:
- <6s: 0.1% (1 recording)
- 6-8s: 0.8% (6 recordings)
- 8-10s: 98.6% (714 recordings)

### Supported Tasks

This dataset is suitable for:
- **Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)**: Training models to transcribe throat microphone audio
- **Speech-to-Text**: Converting throat microphone recordings to text
- **Voice Activity Detection**: Detecting speech in throat microphone signals
- **Domain Adaptation**: Adapting existing ASR models to throat microphone input

### Languages

The dataset contains English-language recordings only, with:
- Standard American English pronunciation
- Academic and technical vocabulary
- Complex sentence structures
- High-quality transcriptions

## Dataset Structure

### Data Instances

Each instance in the dataset contains:
```python
{
    'audio': {
        'path': str,          # Path to the audio file
        'array': np.array,    # The audio signal array
        'sampling_rate': int  # 16000 (16kHz)
    },
    'text': str,             # The transcription
    'duration': float        # Length in seconds
}
```

### Audio Quality

All recordings meet strict quality requirements:
- Sample Rate: 16kHz mono
- Duration: Typically 8-10 seconds (98.6% of recordings)
- Audio Levels: -50dB to 0dB
- Signal-to-Noise Ratio: >10dB
- Silence Ratio: <30%
- Clean, professional recording environment

### Data Fields

- `audio`: Audio file in WAV format (16kHz mono)
- `text`: String containing the transcription
- `duration`: Float value representing duration in seconds

### Data Splits

The dataset is provided as a single training split.

## Dataset Creation

### Curation Rationale

This dataset was created to address the lack of high-quality throat microphone data for training speech recognition models. Throat microphones are particularly useful in noisy environments as they capture speech directly through throat vibrations.

### Source Data

#### Initial Data Collection and Normalization

Sentences were carefully selected to ensure:
- Complexity suitable for model training (9-18 words)
- Proper grammar and punctuation
- Mix of statement types
- Natural language patterns
- Varied vocabulary
- Balanced phonetic content

### Annotations

The annotations (transcriptions) are the original sentences used for recording, ensuring 100% accuracy.

## Considerations for Using the Data

### Social Impact of Dataset

This dataset can help improve speech recognition in:
- High-noise environments
- Military and emergency services communications
- Industrial settings
- Assistive technology for voice disorders

### Discussion of Biases

The dataset:
- Contains only English language
- Uses standard English pronunciation
- May not represent all accents or dialects
- Recorded by a limited number of speakers

### Other Known Limitations

- Limited to throat microphone recordings
- May not generalize well to regular microphone input
- Optimized for 8-10 second utterances
