- ✅ Dataset validation and quality checks
- ✅ Analytics for dataset coverage

### Quality Control
- ✅ Real-time clipping detection
- ✅ Visual level meter
- ✅ Audio quality analysis
- ✅ Automatic format validation (16kHz, mono)
- ✅ Silence detection

## Current Dataset Status
- 180 recordings completed
- Average quality score: 91.1/100
- Identified issues:
  - Some recordings have excessive silence
  - 37 recordings show clipping

## Next Steps

### Short Term
1. **Quality Improvements**
   - [ ] Add silence trimming
   - [ ] Implement automatic gain control
   - [ ] Add batch re-recording for clipped files

2. **Dataset Expansion**
   - [ ] Record additional sentences (target: 1000)
   - [ ] Focus on sentence variety over multiple takes
   - [ ] Add domain-specific sentences

3. **Tool Enhancements**
   - [ ] Add visualization for dataset statistics
   - [ ] Implement batch processing features
   - [ ] Add export options for different formats

### Long Term
1. **Training Pipeline**
   - [ ] Create Whisper fine-tuning script
   - [ ] Add model evaluation tools
   - [ ] Implement inference pipeline

2. **Dataset Distribution**
   - [ ] Create public subset of the dataset
   - [ ] Add documentation for dataset usage
   - [ ] Create example fine-tuning notebooks

## Technical Details

### Current Setup
- Python 3.9.19
- 16kHz mono WAV format
- Hugging Face dataset integration
- Real-time audio processing

### Dependencies
- pyaudio for recording
- librosa for audio analysis
- datasets for Hugging Face integration
- nltk for text analysis

## Issues and Solutions

### Resolved
1. ✅ Buffer overflow during recording
   - Solution: Increased buffer size and added overflow handling
2. ✅ Python version compatibility
   - Solution: Updated dependencies to support Python 3.9
3. ✅ Terminal scrolling with level meter
   - Solution: Implemented single-line updates

### Pending
1. ⏳ Excessive silence in recordings
2. ⏳ Clipping in some recordings
3. ⏳ Need for larger dataset
